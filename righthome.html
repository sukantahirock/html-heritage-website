Travel is the only thing you buy that makes you richer.<br>
Collect moments, not things.<br>
The best things happen outside of our comfort zones.<br>
Don't be a tourist, be a traveler.<br>
Better to see something once than hear about it a thousand times.<br>
I have not been everywhere yet, but it’s on my list.<br>
The only trip you will regret is the one you didn’t take.<br>       
<h1 text-align: center;> Travel heels your heart.</h1>
       <h3> That is why everyone should go to travel.
    </h3><br>
